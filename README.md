## About Inventory Transactions
Inventory Transactions is a web app aimed for business who manage a great amount of products. It not only manages the inventory, but it is used as a sale point to make transactions/sales.

## Main Features
We thought of many features a business may require to manage a good inventory as well as the sales.

### Inventory
The **Inventory Feature** is the main feature, where the users/employees will be using to add the products they want to manage. The Products will be divided into groups so it will be easier to manage and look for specific product.

### Roles
The main features for the Owner is the **Admin Role** feature.

The Owner have the permissions to everything. The main characteristic of this role is to add new users(employees or admins) to the system so each user will be able to take score on their sales as well as managing them.

The **Employee Role** is as the title says, just for the employees. Users with this role will only be able to create new groups, add new products, and manage their sales.

### Cart and Sales
I implemented the **Cart Feature** so the users can be able to manage their sales with ease.

The Cart will, of course, maintain track of the products that a client will buy. The user can add or decrease the quantity of the items as the client desires.
